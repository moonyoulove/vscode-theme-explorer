This extension offers a quick and easy way to manage your editor's themes, fonts, and icons.

You can effortlessly rearrange fonts by dragging them, as well as add or remove items with ease.

Switching themes is just a click away, eliminating the need to scroll through themes one by one using keyboard arrows or repeatedly reopening the theme selection menu.

Additionally, you can schedule random changes to themes, fonts, and icons at set intervals. Choose to have these changes occur every few hours or each time the editor starts.

By clicking the ignore button in the tree view, you can exclude specific themes, fonts, or icons from the random selection, ensuring they won't be chosen.
